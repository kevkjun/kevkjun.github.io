I'm a second year master's student at UChicago interested in high performance computing, distributed systems and fintech. I previously attended Northwestern, majoring in Economics and Political Science.

I enjoy designing and building things that make processes more efficient or accessible.

When I'm not studying or working on projects, I enjoy film, music, cooking and chilling with my beautiful wife, dog and rabbit.
