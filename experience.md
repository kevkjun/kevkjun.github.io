## Wolverine Trading

June 2020 - August 2020

During Summer 2020, I interned at Wolverine Trading where I designed and developed an application to monitor and issue commands to critical machines which connect and send trade orders to exchanges. I was responsible for developing the front-end UI and extending the back-end multithreaded, low-latency messaging passing architecture. Front-end work was done in C# and back-end in C++17.

I previously worked in analytics at **Conversant**, an advertising technology company in Chicago. I provided campaign analyses for large retail clients such as ULTA, Bath and Body Works and Victoria's Secret.
