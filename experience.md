<p>During Summer 2020, I interned at Wolverine Trading where I designed and developed an application to monitor and issue commands to critical machines which connect and send trade orders to exchanges. I was responsible for developing the front-end UI and extending the back-end multithreaded, low-latency messaging passing architecture. Front-end work was done in C# and back-end in C++17.</p>
